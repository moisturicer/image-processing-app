**Image Processing App (WinForms)**

A simple image processing project built with Windows Forms. This application allows you to apply different filters and transformations to images.

**Copy** – Load and display the original image.  
**Greyscale** – Convert the image to shades of gray.  
**Inversion** – Invert all pixel colors (negative effect).  
**Histogram** – Display a histogram of grayscale intensity values.  
**Sepia** – Apply a warm, brownish filter for a vintage effect.  
**Shrink** – Slightly reduces detail by averaging pixels.  
**Smoothen** – Softens edges for a smoother look.  
**Gaussian Blur** – Creates a soft, out-of-focus effect.  
**Sharpen** – Enhances edges and details of the image.  
**Embossing** – Gives a 3D raised or recessed effect.
**Subtraction (Green Screen)** – Replace the green background of one image with another image.  
**Webcam Functionality** – Can capture images using webcam and apply transformations.
